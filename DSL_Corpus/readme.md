# Extracting data from the DSL 2010 corpus
The corpus must be in folder './dsl_corpus_data/'.
The data is extracted into a text file in this folder called 'dsl_sentences.txt', which consists of a sentence on each new line.
The output file is overwritten if run multiple times.
The sentence is the original state of the word from the dataset.
